Cannon - Game Bot


maintaining the state - 

1. **identifying the soldiers (DONE)**
    1. their moves (free)
    2. their moves (enemy is adjacent)
    3. attacks on enemy

2.  **identifying the cannons (DONE)**
    1. their moves
    2. their targets
  
  Now trying to find and remove redundant moves (moves which will result into same state)
  
  Later - Will make the implementation of neighbourhood function more efficient - Will not analyse the whole state again but instead analyse just the changes
