Cannon - Game Bot


Maintaining the state - 

1. **Identifying the soldiers (DONE)**
    1. Their moves (free)
    2. Their moves (enemy is adjacent)
    3. Attacks on enemy

2.  **Identifying the cannons (DONE)**
    1. Their moves
    2. Their targets
  
  Now trying to find and remove redundant moves (moves which will result into same state)
  
  **Later** - Will make the implementation of neighbourhood function more efficient - Will not analyse the whole state again but instead analyse just the changes
